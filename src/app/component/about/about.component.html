            GOAL 12 IN 2019

            <p class="text1">
              Worldwide material consumption has expanded rapidly, as has
              material footprint per capita, seriously jeopardizing the
              achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 12 and the Goals more
              broadly.
              <br /><br />
              Urgent action is needed to ensure that current material needs do
              not lead to the overextraction of resources or to the degradation
              of environmental resources, and should include policies that
              improve resource efficiency, reduce waste and mainstream
              sustainability practices across all sectors of the economy.

            PROGRESS OF<br />
            GOAL 13 IN 2019
            <p class="text1">
              With rising greenhouse gas emissions, climate change is occurring
              at rates much faster than anticipated and its effects are clearly
              felt worldwide. While there are positive steps in terms of the
              climate finance flows and the development of nationally determined
              contributions, far more ambitious plans and accelerated action are
              needed on mitigation and adaptation.<br /><br />
              Access to finance and strengthened capacities need to be scaled up
              at a much faster rate, particularly for least developed countries
              and small island developing States.<br /><br />
